 //  The String object (Data Type) is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.

 //  Strings can be created as primitives, from string literals, or as objects using the string constructor.

 // Strings always represent in Single, Double qoutes and as well as from back ticks(`) in JS.

 //  Example:
 
 //  From String Literals.

 const str1 = "A string primitive";
 const str2 = 'A string primitive';
 const str3 = `A string primitive`;


 // From string Constructor.

 const str4 = new String("A string Object"); // Just Rememeber...Don't confuse, we will learn about this.
