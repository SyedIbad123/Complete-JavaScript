 //  Objects, in JS, are the most important data type and form the building blocks of modern JS.These objects are quite different form JS's primitive data types in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each depending on their type. Objects don't have index. By default key is string.

 //  Example:

 let personal = {

    name:"Syed Ibad",
    location:"Karachi",
    DOB:2004
 }

 console.log(personal.name);   //  Syed Ibad
